# Hi there! 👋  

I’m **Emilio Moreno**. I am a high school student passionate about robotics, data science, AI, and computer engineering.  

## Robotics 🛠️  
I am part of the **FRC Team 3082** ([organization repository here](https://github.com/team3082)), where I’ve contributed to coding our robot. I also serve as the lead developer of **Chicken Planner** ([Chicken Planner Repository](https://github.com/team3082/ChickenPlanner)), an FRC trajectory planner that uses Bézier splines for path planning. Most of my work during the school year will happen there. 

## Interests 🎯  
- **Data Science**: Doing data science competitions on Kaggle and having fun with deep and reinforcement learning
    - **AIs Ultimate Tic Tac Toe**: Making way to complicated AIs for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe using reinforcment learning
- **CPU Design**: Making basic CPUs in logsim, and custom assembly programs for them
- **Unity Games**: Making silly Unity games to mess around with ideas and concepts
- **Random Stuff**: If I find something intresting, I am gonna try to code it, and if I like it enough I will put it on here 😉

*(Repo projects coming soon, a lot of these projects I have started but not finished to a state where I feel good about publishing them, I want you guys to see my best work!)*  

Feel free to explore my repositories and contact me if you have any questions! 🚀
